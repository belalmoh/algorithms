# My Algorithms repository
**This repository aims to implement all of the algorithms that are mentioned in [this](https://goalkicker.com/AlgorithmsBook/) book.**

Also, most of the algorithms will be mainly done in __python__, and there might be some will be done in __R__

> **Disclaimer**: This repository is not the official one to that book, it's just being done for the sake of implementing/revising hard algorithms.


## Done Algorithms:

 1. Adjacent Matrix
